          This web Application is a digital tool designed to help you manage
          tasks and stay organized. Some key features include
          <strong><em>Task Creation</em></strong
          >, where you can add tasks to your list, specifying details like due
          dates, priorities, and descriptions.
          <strong><em>Task Organization</em></strong
          >, tasks can be grouped into categories or projects. For example, you
          might have separate lists for work, personal, or shopping tasks.
          <strong><em>Priority Levels</em></strong
          >, you can assign priority levels (e.g., high, medium, low) to
          functions to focus on what’s most important.
          <strong><em>Due Dates and Reminders</em></strong
          >, setting due dates for tasks and receiving reminders to complete
          them on time. <strong><em>Checklists and Subtasks</em></strong
          >, breaking down larger tasks into smaller subtasks, or creating
          checklists within a task.
          <strong><em>Cross-Platform Syncing</em></strong
          >, many apps sync across devices (web, mobile, desktop) so you can
          access your tasks anywhere finally,
          <strong><em>Completion Tracking</em></strong
          >, marking tasks as done when completed, and they’ll move to a
          separate completed section.
